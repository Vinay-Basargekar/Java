# Java
This Java repository is dedicated to demonstrating the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

### Key Concepts Covered:
- **Class and Object Creation**: The basic building blocks of OOP, showcasing how to define classes and create objects.
- **Constructor Overloading**: Demonstrates how constructors can be overloaded to initialize objects in different ways.
- **Method Overloading**: Illustrates how methods within a class can be overloaded to perform different tasks based on the parameters passed.
- **Static Methods**: Explains the use of static methods and variables, which belong to the class rather than any object of the class.
- **Array of Objects**: Shows how to create and manage arrays of objects for handling multiple objects of the same class.

### Examples:
1. **College.java**: Implements a `College` class to demonstrate constructor overloading, method overloading, static methods, and handling arrays of objects.
2. **Pokemon.java**: A simple class to demonstrate basic class and object creation, along with a method to simulate an action.

This repository serves as a practical guide for beginners to grasp the essentials of OOP in Java, with each example designed to reinforce understanding of these key concepts.
